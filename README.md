# 🤖 Automation Script for logging into LPU Wifi

This script is tested with Google Chrome <b>Version 117.0.5938.92 </b> (Official Build) (64-bit).
<br>

### 🛑 **Edit the automate_login.py file with your own Credentials in place of placeholder text**

<br>Make sure to download chromedriver for the same version for the script to function properly.
<br>
<br>
### Below is the website link to download chromedriver.
https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ 

<br>
Place the chromedriver into the the default C:\ directory. <br>
Example --> `C:\chromedriver.exe`

## 👨‍💻 Make the Script run on Startup 
- Create a TXT file and type the location of your scipt on your computer. Ex.: "cd /d D:\folder-name" <br> (here give the name of the drive and the folder where you have stored the script)
- Hopefully Python is already installed, so just on the next line in the same text file - type: "python automate_login.py"
- Now, save the text file but replace the extension .txt with .bat - this will create a windows batch file.
- Using Windows+R shortcut key to open Run, type **shell:startup** in the text box and click ok.
- It will open a folder where you can put your .bat file that you created.

## Congrats, you just saved yourself the hassle of logging in again and again. 🥳🥳
