# 🤖 Automation Script for logging into LPU Wifi

This script is tested with Google Chrome <b>Version 117.0.5938.92 </b> (Official Build) (64-bit).
<br>

### 🛑 **Edit the automate_login.py file with your own Credentials in place of placeholder text**

<br>Make sure to download chromedriver for the same version for the script to function properly.
<br>
<br>If `pip` is not install, first install `pip`, then install `selenium` with `pip install selenium` on command Prompt 

### Below is the website link to download chromedriver.
> https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ 
<br>

Place the chromedriver into the the default `C:\` directory. <br>
***Example -->*** `C:\chromedriver.exe`


## 👨‍💻 Make the Script run on Startup 
- Create a TXT file and mention the location of `automate_login.py` like `cd /d D:\folder-name` <br> where `D:\folder-name` is replaced by the directory you have saved your `automate_login.py` script in.
- Hopefully Python is already installed, so just on the next line in the same text file add `python automate_login.py`
- Now, save the text file but replace the extension .txt with .bat - this will create a windows batch file.
- Using Windows+R shortcut key to open Run, type **`shell:startup`** in the text box and click ok.
- It will open a folder where you can put your .bat file that you created.

## Congrats, you just saved yourself the hassle of logging in again and again. 🥳🥳
